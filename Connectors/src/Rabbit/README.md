# Rabbit Connector Sample App - RabbitConnection

ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [Steeltoe Rabbit Connector](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors/tree/master/src/Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.Rabbit) for connecting to a Rabbit service on CloudFoundry using [RabbitMQ.Client - 4.1.x](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dotnet-api-guide.html). This specific sample illustrates how to use a `RabbitMQ.Client` to send and receive messages on the bound rabbitmq service.

# Pre-requisites - CloudFoundry

1. Installed Pivotal CloudFoundry 1.7+
2. Installed Rabbit marketplace service
3. Install .NET Core SDK

# Create Rabbit Service Instance on CloudFoundry
You must first create an instance of the Rabbit service in a org/space.

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard myRabbitService 

# Publish App & Push to CloudFoundry

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cd samples/Connectors/src/Rabbit
3. dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config
4. Publish app to a directory
(e.g. `dotnet publish --output $PWD/publish --configuration Release --framework netcoreapp1.1 --runtime ubuntu.14.04-x64`)
5. Push the app using the provided manifest.
(e.g.  `cf push -f manifest.yml -p $PWD/publish` or `cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p $PWD/publish )

Note: The provided manifest will create an app named `rabbit` and attempt to bind to the the app to Rabbit service `myRabbitService`.

# What to expect - CloudFoundry

After building and running the app, you should see something like the following in the logs. 

To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs rabbit`

On a Linux cell, you should see something like this during startup:
```

```
At this point the app is up and running. To send a message click "Send" and send a message over rabbit. Having sent a message, click "Receive" and you will start seeing those messages.
